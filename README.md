Research and Proof of Concepts for 2019's FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition Deep Space Game

### PRATHAM's

- PID Tuning(Distance/Angle) and then Motion Profiling (Pak)
	- Stephanie, Bryan, Alvin
	- Lei, Randy, Ayan (for now)
	- **Goals:**
	1. Code driveStraightCommand
	2. Code rotateDegreesCommand
	3. Get the robot moving with Motion Profiling code
	2. Get a robot to follow a consistent path (aka ideal autos) from Motion Profiling Code
	- SPARK / NEO Motors (Victor, Jin)
	- Lei, Randy, Ayan
	- **Goals:**
	1. Robot moves with NEOS
	2. PID tuning with NEOS
- Camera View (Optimal Quality + Bandwidth Restrictions) (Winston, Timothy)
	- Nicky, Fahad
	- **Goals:**
	1. Successfully broadcast video feed to DriverStation
	2. Find the equilibrium point between high quality and low lag
	3. Overlay crosshairs, data, etc. over the video feed recieved
- On board compressor (Bryan)
	- Justin, Jason, Max
	- **Goals:**
	1. Compress on the robot
	
### HUI MIN's
- Line Sensors (Cynthia, Jin)
	- Sandy, Shirley
	- **Goals:**
	1. Detect Lines (White on Grey Carpet)
	2. Figure out optimal line sensor placement along with alignment logic
	3. Optimize the line sensor code to get the robot moving at a fast speed and still stop at a line while sensing it.
- Running Autons During/After the Sandstorm (Helena)
	- Joshua, Rayat, Miguel
	- **Goals:**
	1. Running autons for 15 sec with 2019 code
	2. Running autons > 15 sec
- Teleop Integration into Auton (Helena)
	- Joshua, Rayat, Miguel
	- **Goals:**
	1. Run Autonomated commands in teleop with push of a button
	2. Operate in sandstorm period
- Motion Profiling with PathWeaver (Tahsin, Kevin)
	- Some of PID tuning group later
	- **Goals:**
	1. Create paths + run paths for autons Blay wants
	2. Tune paths
	3. Implement Motion Profiling + CV
